<p>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</p>
<p>My previous knowledge of HTML/CSS was very little. I don't think I even knew what HTML fully stood for when I started this class, however I had some previous experience with Javascript as I took AP Computer Science Principles in my High School in which we used Code.org and used javascript as well. </p>

<p>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</p>
<p>I used what we created from Module 4 for my portfolio, as I was most used to that code and I knew where everything was. I edited the portfolio lots though, but went with the theme it had.</p>
<p>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</p>
<p> I think the most challenging part of the portfolio was creating the thank you page. For some reason, my code would never work when submiting and validating was a little hard for me as well. </p>

<p>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? </p>
<p> I have a newfound respect for web developers, it certainly takes a lot of testing and trials and it is more complicated than it seems, it's not just adding buttons to sites. </p>


<p>What would you recommend to future students taking this class? </p>
<p> I would definitely recommend to future students to do their own reserch on good websites to use to practice html, css, and js. I would also tell them to be patient and don't worry if their code does not work the first time, sometimes the error can be as small as a missing bracket! Definitely check for validation as well. </p>
