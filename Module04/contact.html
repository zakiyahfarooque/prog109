		<!-- page must have a form that collects the user's name, a subject for the message and an area to enter additional information from the user. Once the form is submitted, a Thank you page should be shown.

NOTE:  We are not doing SERVER-SIDE scripting, but just simulating how to send the data to the server.  The way this work is by using the attribute action in your <form>:

<form action="name-of-your-thankyou-page.html" method="get"
name="myContact">
