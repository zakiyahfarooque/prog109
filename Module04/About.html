      <h1>Welcome to the About Me Page!</h1>
      <h2>My name is Zakiyah and I am a Running Start student who goes to Eastlake High School! I love to hike, listen to music, and spend quality time with others. My goals in this class are to have some experience programming and developing websites. I hopefully want to pursue a Computer Science degree at UW Seattle and one day work in the tech industry and work with AI.</h2>
